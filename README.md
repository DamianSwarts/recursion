# Recursion Practice â€“ The Odin Project

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of classic recursive and iterative algorithms, created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal was to deepen understanding of **recursion** and how it can be applied to solve problems like generating Fibonacci sequences and sorting arrays.
